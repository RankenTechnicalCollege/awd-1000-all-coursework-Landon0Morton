      <p>I am using Visual Studios as my text editor to complete this assignment.</p>

      <p>Building a website means you have to take into consideration what the receiver or future owner of this website wants. After figuring out how they want it designed you will then need to plan a site map and wireframe. Once you are done with the planning stages you can then decide what types of graphics and visuals, such as but not limited to colors, font size, images, etc that you want on the website. </p>
      
      <p>In Chapter 1, I have learned to design and plan out websites, as well as new coding terminology and language.</p>

            <div class="box sticky">

                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>The sticky position will follow the user until they scroll to the bottom or top of the "container" it is in where it will stick.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box relative">

                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>I used a 90 px value for the top and a 30 px value for the left which means it will be 90 pixels from the top and 30 pixels from the left of its original position.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box fixed">

                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>I used a value of 90 px for the top and a value of 10 pixels for the right, meaning the fixed property will stay 90 pixels from the top and 10 pixels from the right at all times.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box absolute">

                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>I used a 0 value from the bottom and for the right value, meaning that the absolute position will always sit at 0 from the right and bottom of it's "container".</p>
